#+AUTHOR:Michael Cardiff
* The Method
This program uses completeness of the solutions to the infinite square well problem in order to solve for any arbitrary potential in 1 dimension
* Provided Potentials
- Basic Square Well potential
- Linear Potential
- Quadratic Potential
- Centered Quadratic to mimic harmonic oscillator potential
- Square Barrier Potential
- Linear Potential Turned on at x=0.5
- Coupled Quadratic Potentials
- Kronig-Penney Potential
* How to Use
Simply run
